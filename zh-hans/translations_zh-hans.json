  "\"*Are we sure* we're going the right way...?\"\n  \nYour hired wizard asks the question as you enter a fork in the road, with a doubtful expression on her face and her own weapon drawn. The place is crawling with dangerous enemies. You know the Philosopher's Stone has to be somewhere here - but... *where*?\n\n\"H-Hold on - let me focus...\" The Headmaster is the one who answers her, closing his eyes. For half a minute, your wizard companion and you stay still and silent.": "“我们*确定*走对路了吗……？”\n  \n当你进入一处分叉路口时，你雇佣的巫师发出了疑问，她脸上带着怀疑的面色，手里紧握着武器。这个地方到处都是危险的敌人。你知道贤者之石一定就在这里的某个地方——但是……在*哪儿*？\n\n“等——等一下，让我集中精神……”校长闭上眼睛回答了她。整整半分钟，你和你的巫师同伴都静静地站在原地。",
  "\"*Of course they wouldn't let us in!* This place is so famous, they must be swarming with prospective students and all kinds of nosy people.\" Your hired wizard doesn't seem surprised.\n  \nBut you feel something is odd. For a place this famous, it surely looks... *deserted*. There is nobody in sight.": "“*他们当然不会让我们进去！* 这个地方这么有名，肯定到处都是未来的学生和各种爱管闲事的人。”你雇佣的巫师似乎并不感到意外。\n  \n但你觉得有些古怪。对于一个如此有名的地方，它看起来确实……*荒废了*。目力所及空无一人。",
  "\"*Satell*... is the Divine that you are looking for. And... he is not following our code. Our rules. Our policy of non-intervention in our Worlds, except in specific circumstances.\"\n  \nWhat are they talking about? Rules? Non-intervention?": "“*萨特尔*……就是你在寻找的神圣。而且……他没有遵守我们的准则。我们的规则。我们在特定情况外，不对我们的世界进行干预的政策。”\n  \n他们在说什么？规则？不干预？",
  "\"A wanted poster? We get several of those, fairly often, at the guild\", she mentions. \"It looks like this one references a nefarious alchemist that seems to be running experiments somewhere in the town sewers. It appears the wells in some places in town have become poisoned, and the town suspects this alchemist.\"\n  \nThen something she says catches your attention: \"It says here that the experiments have something to do with creating a Philosopher's Stone...\" *Your blood freezes.* You ask her to repeat and confirm the fact. She is not lying to you: that is what it says on the paper.": "“一张通缉令？我们公会经常能收到好几张这种东西，”她提到，“看起来这张通缉的是一名邪恶的炼金术士，他似乎在小镇的下水道里进行某种实验。镇上有些地方的水井被投了毒，镇民怀疑是这名炼金术士干的。”\n  \n接着，她的一句话引起了你的注意：“上面说这些实验与制造贤者之石有关……”*你的血液凝固了。*你要求她重复一遍并确认事实。她没有撒谎：纸上确实是这么写的。",
  "\"A-a v-visitor...?\"\n    \nYou hear a voice from above the main door. There is a window there.

  "\"After that... I-I forgot all about it, until one day, not t-too long ago, they approached me... and they said that they would renounce their position as Headmaster, and that I-I was to be their successor... and so it happened, as they left on an endeavour to 'create a new World' or so,\" he continues.\n    \n\"And as part of the first duties I did as a H-Headmaster... I did a full inventory of the School's treasury... and to do so, of course, I undid the lock on the Philosopher's Stone, to make sure it was still there.\" He looks down, with a somber expression.\n\n\"Of course, that was a b-big mistake. The l-lock was not just meant to *keep people away* from the Stone, but also to *conceal its location*. A-And when I undid it... t-that effect was lost...\"": "“在那之后……我——我把这事全忘了，直到不久前的某一天，他们找到我……说他们要放弃校长的职位，而我——我要成为他们的继任者……事情就这样发生了，他们离开去尝试‘创造一个新世界’之类的，”他继续说道。\n    \n“作为我接任校长后的首批职责之一……我对学院的宝库进行了全面盘点……为了做到这一点，我当然解开了贤者之石上的锁，以确保它还在那里。”他低下头，神情黯然。\n\n“当然，那是一个大——大错误。那把锁不仅是为了*让人远离*贤者之石，也是为了*隐藏它的位置*。而——而当我解开它时……那项效果消失了……”",
  "\"Ah, I see it's caught your eye,\" exclaims the merchant. \"This was written by a celebrity professor of a school of magic. It describes a way to *record* Essence Catalysts somehow, so that they can be used even when they are no longer there... how is that even possible, I wouldn't know, I'm not a wizard,\" he says.\n      \nYou are intrigued. That could be so useful - how much easier would it have been to set up your home if that was possible?! Until he says: \"Very useful, isn't it? It can be yours for *500K:coins:*. And not a single one less!\"\n\nThat's... a lot of :coins:, and you did already set up your Essence Catalysts, after all. You think again about whether it's worth buying the book...": "“啊，我看到它吸引了你的注意，”商人惊呼道，“这是由一位魔法学院的名教授编写的。它描述了一种能够*记录*精华催化剂的方法，以便即使催化剂不在原位也能被使用……这怎么可能呢，我也搞不明白，毕竟我不是巫师，”他说道。\n      \n你被激起了好奇心。如果那是真的，那简直太有用了——如果可以做到的话，布置你的家会变得多么简单？！直到他说：“非常有用的东西，不是吗？只要 *500K:coins:* 它就是你的了。少一个子儿都不行！”\n\n那可是……一笔巨额的:coins:，而且你毕竟已经布置好了精华催化剂。你再次思考花钱买下这本书是否值得……",
  "\"Although I cannot teach you anything else, there is one free service I can offer you: *damage measurement*\". The knight offers you a small piece of paper. You recognize the names of multiple spells, and attached to each of them is a number.\n      \n\"This is *how much damage you dealt with each attack* on your last fight\", he says. You look at the numbers again. You are a little dizzy trying to make sense out of it...": "“虽然我不能再教你别的了，但我可以为你提供一项免费服务：*伤害测试*”。骑士递给你一小张纸。你认出了上面写的多个法术名称，每个名称后面都附有一个数字。\n      \n“这是你在上一场战斗中*每次攻击造成的伤害量*，”他说道。你再次看向那些数字。你试图弄明白它们的含义，却感到有些头晕目眩……",
  "\"And let us also give you *a little extra*, as well.\" The Divine waves their arms. Your body is bathed in a warm light and you feel a unique power coursing through it.\n  \nYou have a good feeling about it. Somehow, it feels like you can harness a power you've never really *felt* before. Is it the power of Divinity...?": "“而且，让我们也给你*一点额外的小礼物*吧。”神圣挥动双臂。你的身体沐浴在温暖的光芒中，你感觉到一种独特的能量流经全身。\n  \n你对此感觉良好。不知为何，你觉得你可以驾驭一种从未真正*感受*过的力量。这就是神圣之力吗……？",
  "\"And,\" he also exclaims, \"I'll cast spells under your lead. I-I'm still quite a novice Headmaster... and probably s-should have never been one... but... I know how to follow someone's lead and cast spells really, *really well*.\"\n\n**You have unlocked a new Exploration area: \"Aberrant Realm\"!**\n\n**The Magical Research card grants you a +50% bonus to Study for the rest of the run!**\n\n**And finally, the Headmaster's skillful spellcasting under someone's orders grants you the equivalent of 5 extra Wizards!**": "“而且，”他又喊道，“我会在你的领导下施法。我——我还只是个新手校长……可能压——压根就不该当这个校长……但是……我知道如何服从别人的领导，并且把法术施展得非常、*非常好*。”\n\n**你已解锁新的探索区域：“异变领域”！**\n\n**魔法研究卡片将使你本轮剩余时间的学习效率提升 +50%！**\n\n**最后，校长在指挥下的精湛施法效果等同于 5 名额外的巫师！**",
  "\"As a special offer, I will join you entirely *for free*!\" As she says this, she decides to come inside your home. You are shocked - you didn't agree to anything yet! You are ready to kick her out. But before you reply, you pause and think about it some more. Having someone else helping you cast all those spells would certainly be a big help. Even more so if for free.\n    \nYou ask her to channel some Water, and then you notice her struggling. Beads of sweat start forming on her forehead as she tries to focus to show you her supposed skills. Eventually, she comes through, although she appears to be pretty exhausted. She surprisingly appears to be even less skilled than you are... *no wonder* the offer was actually free.": "“作为一个特殊优惠，我会完全*免费*加入你的行列！”说完这话，她就径自走进了你的家。你惊呆了——你还没答应任何事呢！你准备把她赶出去。但在你开口之前，你停下来又想了想。有人能帮着施展所有那些法术肯定会是个大帮手。更何况还是免费的。\n    \n你请她引导一些水元素，然后你注意到她非常吃力。当她试图集中精神展示她所谓的技能时，额头上开始渗出汗珠。最终，她成功了，虽然她看起来已经精疲力竭。令人惊讶的是，她看起来甚至比你还没经验……*难怪*这服务真的是免费的。",
  "\"As you can see... your World is but one of countless different ones. Each one... a different possibility, a different imagined reality - created by someone that is not bound to the constraints of a World... And someone sufficiently skilled with Magic can move between them at will.\"\n    \n\"This... is the *Truth of the World*.\" She says it solemnly.": "“如你所见……你的世界只是无数不同世界中的一个。每一个……都是一种不同的可能性，一个不同的想象现实——由某种不受世界约束的存在所创造……而一个魔法技艺足够精湛的人可以在这些世界之间随意移动。”\n    \n“这……就是*世界的真相*。”她庄重地说道。",
  "\"Automation\" Offering (Requires Ring of Mental Exertion +9)": "“自动化”祭品（需要 精神苦修之戒 +9）",
  "\"B-Before I even left the treasury, a portal appeared right inside, and an *army* of aberrant creatures started coming out of it! A-And I couldn't close the portal!\" You can feel his pain as he tells his story. Your wizard companion, too, appears worried.\n    \n\"S-So... of course, my priority instead had to switch - and I evacuated everyone else from the School and trapped those *creatures* in here,\" he says. \"I-I'm glad I was able to... but when I came back to the treasury, the Philospher's Stone was *gone*. N-No doubt taken by those creatures.\"": "“在——在我还没离开宝库之前，里面就凭空出现了一个传送门，一支由异变生物组成的*大军*开始从中涌出！而——而且我无法关闭传送门！”听着他的讲述，你能感受到他的痛苦。你的巫师同伴看起来也很担心。\n    \n“所——所以……理所当然地，我必须改变优先级——我疏散了学院里的其他人，并把那些*生物*困在了这里，”他说道，“我——我很庆幸我做到了……但当我回到宝库时，贤者之石已经*不见了*。没——没准就是被那些生物拿走了。”",
  "\"But you are too late. The procedures are complete. We are unstoppable now.\" She stands up, and turns to face you. Her hair, dark as obsidian, grouped in thick strands, waves behind her from magical power - and covers her visage, leaving only a faint smile.": "“但你来得太晚了。仪式已经完成。现在的我们已经势不可挡。”她站起身，转过头面对着你。她那如黑曜石般深色的长发，在魔法的激荡下如厚实的丝缕般在身后飘动——遮住了她的面庞，只留下一抹淡淡的微笑。”",
  "\"But...\" He stops for a moment. For a second, you think he is going to steal the lamp, and you warn him. But he just laughs, loudly, and for nearly a minute.\n  \n\"No, I would never do that... it would be *completely useless* to me! Just as useless as it is to you!\"\n\nYou are not sure why he said that, but he explains shortly after: \"This artifact, the Boosting Lamp, does not work for just anyone. Whoever uses it must be someone that, *since they were children*, was raised next to and nurtured by it. No, none of us can use this now, and we won't be able to in our lives!\"": "“但是……”他停顿了一下。有一瞬间，你以为他要偷走那盏灯并向他发出了警告。但他只是大笑起来，笑声很大，持续了将近一分钟。\n  \n“不，我绝不会那样做……因为那对我来说*完全没用*！就像对你一样没用！”\n\n你不确定他为什么这么说，但他很快解释道：“这件神器，增幅之灯，并不是对谁都起作用的。使用者必须是那种*从小*就在它身边被培育和滋养的人。不，我们现在谁也用不了，这辈子都没戏了！”",
  "\"Congratulations on your victory\", she exclaims. \"You've certainly come a long way, haven't you?\"\n    \n\"Let me introduce myself\", she continues. \"I am the head instructor of combat - my name is Giselle. I am the one who extended you the invitation for this extra training course at these four Towers of Training. I don't think you have noticed me, but I saw you at the top of each of the Towers - and noticed your fights against the four guardians at the top. You did an excellent job.\" You thank her for the kind words.": "“祝贺你获得胜利，”她高声说道，“你确实走了很长一段路，不是吗？”\n    \n“让我自我介绍一下，”她继续说道，“我是战斗总教官——我叫吉赛尔。是我向你发出了这四座训练塔特殊训练课程的邀请。我想你可能没有注意到我，但我曾在每一座塔的顶端注视着你——也见证了你与塔顶四位守护者的战斗。你表现得非常出色。”你对她的赞许表示了感谢。",
  "\"Efficiency\" Offering (Requires Earth Lv45, 5M Earth Essence)": "“效率”祭品（需要地元素 Lv45，5M 地之精华）",
  "\"Go now. Be on your way.\" The Divine starts moving their wings, floating in the air, and then swiftly they fly away. You follow them with your eyes, but you lose them from sight in mere seconds.\n  \nYou look at the Divine Script. You knew how to make it, but getting the materials was... difficult. This will certainly come in handy.": "“走吧，继续你的旅程。”这位神圣生物开始挥动背后的双翼，悬浮在空中，随后迅速飞离。你目送着他们，但仅仅几秒钟后，他们便消失在视线中。\n  \n你低头看向《神圣手稿》。你原本就知道如何制作它，但收集材料的过程确实……非常困难。这肯定会派上用场。",
  "\"Halt! I mean you no harm\", she exclaims. \"I am just quite impressed by your command of Death and the sheer power of your /familiarName/.\"\n      \nShe asks you: \"You are... not actually a Zeth, are you?\"\n\nYou are not really quite sure how to answer...": "“站住！我并无恶意，”她高声说道，“我只是对你操控死亡的能力，以及你的/familiarName/那纯粹的力量感到印象深刻。”\n      \n她询问你：“你……其实并不是泽斯人，对吧？”\n\n你实在不太确定该如何回答……",
  "\"Halt! You may *not* pass!\"\n      \nYou only manage to make a few steps towards the arch before you are interrupted. The voice came from a golden armor-clad elf. They seem much more powerful than those other elves that have been ambushing you, and they're holding a large magic staff.\n\nWith someone like that in the way, you are convinced they are protecting something valuable. But they look very strong... you contemplate what to do.": "“站住！你不准通过！”\n      \n你刚朝拱门走了几步就被打断了。声音来自一名身穿金甲的精灵。他们看起来比之前那些伏击你的精灵要强大得多，手里还握着一根巨大的魔法杖。\n\n有这样的人挡路，你坚信他们一定在守护着某种珍贵的宝物。但他们看起来非常强悍……你正在思索该如何应对。",
  "\"However\", he says, \"you will first need to show me that you can at least handle some basic combat. Let's have a short duel - *don't worry, I will not use my full strength* - and if you are able to win, I'll teach you some advanced combat techniques.\"\n    \nYou are now wary of him. He looks very strong. Is this really going to be possible?\n\n\"I will heal you before we begin, but otherwise, make sure you are ready for combat before we duel\", he finishes saying, before putting his helmet back on. You heed his words, and ready up for combat.": "“不过，”他说道，“你首先需要向我证明你至少懂得一些基础格斗。我们来一场简短的决斗——*别担心，我不会用全力的*——如果你能赢，我就教你一些高级战斗技巧。”\n    \n你此时对他充满了警惕。他看起来实力不凡，这真的可行吗？\n\n“开始前我会为你疗伤，但除此以外，请确保你在决斗前已经做好了战斗准备，”他在重新戴上头盔前补充道。你听从了他的建议，做好了战斗准备。",
  "\"I didn't manage to tell you, but... these portals really fascinate me\", she continues. \"I learned magic because I wanted to *amaze* others with my powers. When I was little... I was playing with my little brother in our yard, when he accidentally fell into one of those portals. I followed him into this other realm. And what I found was... a world that was simply *amazing*!\"\n  \n\"In that world, there were countless bird-looking ships cruising through the air as if it was water, there were walls with moving pictures and even inconspicuous boxes that played the most delightful music as if a band was right inside them! And somehow... the place felt *brighter* and *more vivid* in a way this world hasn't felt to me before.\"\n\n\"If there is any way to recreate those things, it has to be through magic. So as soon as I managed to make it back, that became my goal: to learn magic to make the world more *amazing*.\"": "“我还没来得及告诉你，但是……这些传送门真的让我着迷，”她继续说道，“我学习魔法是因为我想用自己的力量让别人感到*惊叹*。我小时候……有一次和弟弟在院子里玩，他意外掉进了其中一个传送门。我跟着他进入了另一个领域。而我发现的是……一个简直太*神奇*的世界！”\n  \n“在那个世界里，有无数像鸟一样的船在空中巡航，仿佛空气就是水；那里有能显示动态影像的墙壁，甚至还有不起眼的盒子里传出最美妙的音乐，仿佛里面就藏着一支乐队！不知为何……那个地方给我的感觉比这个世界更加*明亮*、更加*鲜活*，那是我从未有过的体验。”\n\n“如果有什么方法可以重现那些事物，那一定是魔法。所以当我一回到这里，这就成了我的目标：通过学习魔法，让世界变得更加*神奇*。”",
  "\"I happened to be walking through, and I heard something about some Essence Catalyst,\" he explains. \"I'm well aware just how important these are to wizards of all skill levels.\"\n      \n\"But wasn't it *difficult* to build them? Wasn't it slow, channeling all that :fireessence:? Well... *I have a solution!*\"\n\nThe merchant pulls out a book from his bag. It reads: *\"Outessenced\"*. There is a drawing of an Essence Catalyst on the cover, but next to it, there appear to be many, many other Essence Catalysts drawn, except these are only outlined. The book catches your interest. What could this possibly be about?": "“我恰好路过，听到有人在谈论精华催化剂，”他解释道，“我很清楚这些东西对于各种水平的巫师来说有多么重要。”\n      \n“但是建造它们不是很*困难*吗？引导那么多:fireessence:不是很慢吗？好吧……*我有办法解决！*”\n\n商人从包里掏出一本书。书名写着：*《精华之外》*。封面上画着一个精华催化剂，但在它的旁边，似乎还画了许许多多其他的精华催化剂，只不过那些只是轮廓。这本书引起了你的兴趣。这究竟会是关于什么的呢？",
  "\"I have a *hunch*: perhaps something is there that could help us\", she exclaims almost cheerfully.\n    \nYou're not sure how she could be so oblivious to the situation, but it was true that the fight pushed you to your limits...\n\n**You have unlocked two new Exploration areas: the \"Zeth Fortress\" itself where the Philosopher's Stone is at, and the \"Dragon Shrine\" at the side of its entrance!**": "“我有一种*直觉*：也许那里有能帮到我们的东西，”她几乎是欢快地喊道。\n    \n你不确定她怎么会对眼下的状况如此漫不经心，但确实，刚才那场战斗已经让你拼尽了全力……\n\n**你已解锁两个新的探索区域：贤者之石所在的“泽斯要塞”，以及位于其入口旁的“巨龙神龛”！**",
  "\"I have something just for you. This *book*,\" he exclaims, while taking something out from his backpack and showing it to you. It is, indeed, a book: the cover reads \"The Basics of Advertising\".\n  \n\"With this book, you'll be able to get much more value out of the things that you decide to sell - if you do a lot of this, it will *definitely* come in handy!\"\n\nIt sounds like a good idea, until he says: \"I'd be happy to sell it to you for *10K:coins:*. Which I'm sure you'll be able to make back in no time!\" That price feels very *steep*. You really feel like this merchant is using that very technique on you. You're not sure of whether you should buy it or not...": "“我有件很适合你的东西。就是这本*书*，”他一边说，一边从背包里掏出一件东西展示给你看。那确实是一本书，封面上写着《广告学基础》。\n  \n“有了这本书，你卖出的东西就能获得更高的价值——如果你经常做交易，这*绝对*能派上用场！”\n\n这听起来是个好主意，直到他说道“我很高兴用*10K:coins:*的价格把它卖给你。我相信你很快就能赚回来的！”这个价格感觉非常*离谱*。你真切地感觉到这位商人正在对你使用这种推销技巧。你不确定是否该买下它……",
  "\"I think we could break this if we had a pickaxe\", says your wizard. \"Although it is a lot of work, I think using a strong spell to blast it would be very dangerous.\"\n      \nYou've certainly transmuted some similar things in the past. What would it take to create a sturdy enough Pickaxe? You deliberate for a while, until you come up with a solid idea. You are going to need quite a bit of silver and Earth Prisms...": "“我想如果我们有一把矿镐，就能把这玩意儿砸开，”你的巫师说道，“虽然这需要干不少苦力活，但我认为用强力咒语轰开它会非常危险。”\n      \n你以前确实转化过类似的东西。要制造一把足够坚固的矿镐需要什么？你思索了一会儿，终于想出了一个切实可行的方案。你将需要相当数量的白银和地棱镜……",
  "\"I will introduce myself. I am... *Lytha*, the *Doom Sorceress*. Pleased... to meet you.\" She bows deeply; almost as if mocking you.\n    \nYou get straight to the point: you ask her about the Philosopher's Stone... and you see her lips curving into a smile.": "“让我自我介绍一下。我是……莉瑟，*厄运女巫*。很高兴……见到你。”她深深地鞠了一躬，简直就像是在嘲弄你。\n    \n你开门见山地向她打听贤者之石的事……随后你看到她的嘴角泛起了一抹微笑。",
  "\"I've been actually watching you since you started exploring, and - I've noticed the various kinds of enemies you have been fighting and items you have been finding. And I've been *recording information* about them!\" She shows you a book, titled *\"Compendium\"*.\n      \nYou admit you are a little intrigued. You walk up to her and open the book. It is barely filled in, but the few pages that have writing in them have quite a lot of information - including even *drawings* of each of the enemies you have defeated!": "“其实自从你开始探索以来，我就一直在关注你。我注意到了你对抗的各种敌人以及你发现的各种物品。而且我一直在*记录*它们的信息！”她向你展示了一本书，书名是《图鉴》。\n      \n你承认自己有点被勾起了好奇心。你走上前翻开那本书。目前记录的内容还很少，但那寥寥几页写有文字的页面却包含了不少信息——甚至还画着你击败过的每一个敌人的*素描*！",
  "\"I've heard the best Wizards out there actually use *different* spells\", she begins to explain. \"Those Wizards, I think they use Spellcrafting to *strengthen* and *modify* their individual favorite spells. I think Prisms were one important reagent in this process!\"\n  \nShe appears to be struggling, though: \"But... I am not really sure how to do it...\" She looks at you, fairly determined: \"But you should *definitely* hold on to those /element/ Prisms! And we should figure out how to do it - those foes keep getting stronger and stronger!\" But she finally simply asks, out of energy again: \"Do you... um... know how we could learn how to Spellcraft...?\"\n\nYou give it a little thought. It might be a stretch, but you feel like you *do* know someone to ask about this, although you're not sure if you *want* to...": "“我听说那些顶尖的巫师其实会使用*与众不同*的法术，”她开始解释道，“那些巫师，我想他们通过法术制作来*强化*和*修改*他们各自钟爱的法术。我想棱镜就是这个过程中的一种重要反应剂！”\n  \n不过，她似乎有些犯难：“但是……我不太确定具体该怎么做……”她看着你，眼神十分坚定：“但你*绝对*要留着那些/element/棱镜！我们得搞清楚该怎么做——那些敌人变得越来越强了！”最后她还是泄了气，小声问道：“你……那个……知道我们该怎么学习法术制作吗……？”\n\n你仔细想了想。虽然有点牵强，但你觉得自己*确实*知道找谁打听这件事，尽管你不确定自己是否*想*去问那个人……",
  "\"I-I've been here ever since... trying to devise a plan to recover the Philosopher's Stone and bring the School back to normal... b-but I couldn't come up with anything,\" he exclaims. Then he looks straight in your eye. \"Until *you came*, that is!\"\n    \n\"W-We must *venture through the portal* into their base and fight them - and retrieve the Philosopher's Stone from their claws! And with your strength, I k-know we can do it!\" The Headmaster's expression lights up.

  "\"Is someone there?\" The coarse voice comes from inside. \"Come in.\"\n    \nYour hired wizard and you hesitantly enter. On the other side of the door is a room that is fancied like a study, or a lab perhaps - shelves full of potions and substances of various colors, several books, and a large desk in the center with flasks and other glass containers. On the other side of the desk is the so-called \"Mad Alchemist\": a man in his later years, with grey curly hair, a furrowed brow, and a peculiar scent.": "“有人在那里吗？”房间里传出一个沙哑的声音，“进来吧。”\n    \n你和你雇佣的巫师迟疑地走了进去。门后是一个布置成书房、或者说是实验室的房间——架子上摆满了各种颜色的药水和物质，还有好几本书，中央有一张大桌子，上面放着烧瓶和其他玻璃容器。桌子的另一边坐着那位所谓的“疯狂炼金术士”：一个男人，上了年纪，满头灰色卷发，眉头紧锁，身上还有股特殊的气味。",
  "\"It just so happens that these potions are my specialty. I know how to make them particularly strong, but if you'd like me to teach you, you'll first have to show me that you have enough experience to understand my explanation.\"\n  \nShe then asks you: \"Show me that you can do this. Bring me 6 Health Potions, and I will consider telling you about it.\"\n\nShe starts turning back on you, but right before she does so, she interrupts herself to say one last thing: \"Oh, and - in case you didn't know - you can transmute Health Potions by having Water Lv6 or higher.\"": "“碰巧这些药水是我的拿手好戏。我知道怎么把它们做得格外出色，但如果你想让我教你，你首先得向我证明你有足够的经验能听懂我的讲解。”\n  \n接着她要求道：“证明给我看。给我带 6 瓶生命药水，我会考虑告诉你这件事。”\n\n她开始转身离开，但就在转身之前，她又停下来补充了最后一句：“噢，还有——万一你不知道的话——水元素等级达到 6 级或更高就能转化生命药水。”",
  "\"It's *blazing hot*!\" The complaint from your hired wizard is plainly true. You look around. All you can see is a barren landscape full of sand. Without vegetation, it's very clear why there is no relief... or chance for relief.\n      \nYou pull out the 100 :elementalPrismLife:Life Prisms that you are holding. These powerful gems... maybe with those you would be able to turn the desert into a forest? Or at least, create an oasis...?\n\nBut no matter how hard you try, you believe that is going to be very difficult, even with your vast :mana:. You put them away...": "“简直是*酷热难耐*！”你雇佣的巫师发出的抱怨绝对属实。你环顾四周，所见之处皆是满目疮痍的荒沙。这里没有任何植被，也难怪完全找不到遮阴的地方……或者缓解炎热的机会。\n      \n你拿出手中持有的 100 个:elementalPrismLife:生命棱镜。这些强大的宝石……也许利用它们，你能将这片沙漠化为森林？或者至少，创造一片绿洲……？\n\n但不管你怎么努力，你都觉得即便拥有浩瀚的:mana:，这依然是一件极难完成的事。你重新把宝石收了起来……",
  "\"L-Let me first tell you a little about myself... I am the Headmaster of the School, but I am not the one who won the Tournament of Magic. No... that would be my teacher.

I was the first apprentice they had. *The first apprentice of the School.*\"\n      \n\"About t-ten years ago... that's when *they*... the previous Headmaster... brought the Philosopher's Stone here.

  "\"Monstium is a key material used for *Enhancements*, medium-to-long-term all-encompassing magical effects that radically affect so many different things\", she explains. \"For example, there are Enhancements for greatly increasing your Essence storage, giving you extra combat power, enabling you to build new types of furniture, and many more.\"\n     \nShe also tells you about Paper, another important requirement for Enhancements. Thankfully, Paper can apparently be transmuted quite easily - she also tells you how to do so.\n\nShe tells you about a few Enhancements and what you need in order to activate them. You listen intently, while realizing how deeply transformative those Enhancements could be. You want to take notes, but you did not bring such material with you - but you think you can remember, at least this time.": "“魔物质是用于*强化*的关键材料，这是一种中长期的全方位魔法效果，能从根本上影响许多不同的事物。”她解释道，“例如，有些强化可以大幅增加你的精华存储上限，赋予你额外的战斗力，让你能建造新型家具等等。”\n     \n她还向你提到了纸，这是强化的另一个重要需求。庆幸的是，纸似乎可以很容易地被转化出来——她还教了你转化的方法。\n\n她向你介绍了其中的几种强化以及激活它们所需的条件。你专注地倾听着，意识到这些强化将带来多么深刻的变革。你想做点笔记，但没带纸笔——不过你想，至少这次你应该能记住。",
  "\"Nice job! I almost can't believe what I just saw\", exclaims your hired wizard, patting you in the back. \"They were amazingly strong and they used magic I've never ever seen before!\"\n    \nYou are relieved the fight is over - it was, without a doubt, difficult.": "“干得漂亮！我简直不敢相信我刚才看到的，”你雇佣的巫师惊叹道，拍了拍你的背，“他们强得惊人，而且使用的魔法我以前从未见过！”\n    \n这场战斗终于结束了，你松了一口气——毫无疑问，这一仗打得很艰难。",

I haven't seen you doing it even once!\"": "“噢，当然可以！”她从盒子里抓起两件饰品戴在身上。你困惑地盯着她，随后她只是简单地说道：\n\n“你可以同时装备*两件*饰品！”\n\n……什么？费了这么大劲……她想说的就*这*？\n\n“这可是至关重要的技巧！我一次都没见你用过！”",
  "\"Portals like these are rare\", exclaims the hired wizard. \"They often lead to an entirely different area, and are a mystery - no one knows exactly what, or who, causes them.

But this one is very pretty!\"\n  \nIt is your first time seeing one, however, so you are very unsure about it - and magic can be very dangerous. You push your weapon through the portal, and hit the ground on the other side - it appears to be solid. Perhaps it is fine after all...?": "“像这样的传送门非常罕见，”雇佣巫师惊呼道，“它们通常通往一个完全不同的区域，而且充满了谜团——没人确切知道它们是怎么出现的，又是谁创造了它们。有时它们甚至能通往不同的世界！”\n\n“我以前确实见过一个，”她犹豫了一下，继续说道，“但是……啊，总之那说来话长。不过这个真的很漂亮！”\n  \n但这还是你第一次见到这种东西，所以你感到很不确定——而且魔法可能非常危险。你试着把武器穿过传送门，碰到了另一边的地面——似乎很坚实。也许终究没问题……？",

You spot your hired wizard with the corner of your eye, awestruck at the sight of the visitor.": "“向你致敬，”他摘下头盔说道，“我是一名战斗训练师，我观察了你最近的战斗。”\n      \n他停顿了一会儿。你用余光瞥见你雇佣的巫师，她正一脸崇拜地看着这位访客。",

But their armor and movements appear very skilled, so you're inclined to believe him.\n\nYour hired wizard watches you, from a distance, but she seems more enthralled with the knight than anything else.": "“向你致敬，”他摘下头盔说道，“我是一名战斗训练师，我观察了你最近的战斗。”他继续道：“我掌握一些更先进的战斗方式，绝对能帮你扭转战局。如果你愿意，我可以教你其中一些。”\n      \n你觉得这是个好主意。你向他询问学费，他却摇了摇头：“我不以从困难者身上获利为乐。”你不太理解这个人，但他的铠甲和动作显得非常老练，所以你倾向于相信他。\n\n你雇佣的巫师在远处看着你们，但比起谈话，她似乎更迷恋这位骑士的身影。",
  "\"Sell them? But... they have so much magical power\", she replies, somewhat disappointed. Then she asks you an unexpected question: \"Have you heard about *Spellcrafting*?\"\n  \nSpellcrafting... The term sounds a little familiar, but very distant. It's as if you heard it once during magical school... but you don't really know what it is.": "“卖掉它们？可是……它们蕴含着如此强大的魔法，”她回答道，显得有些失望。接着她问了你一个意想不到的问题：“你听说过*法术制作*吗？”\n  \n法术制作……这个词听起来有点耳熟，但又很遥远。好像在巫师学校学习时听人提到过一次……但你并不真正了解它是什么。",

  "\"That was way too dangerous! You can't just grab things like treasure without being careful! You could have gotten seriously injured, or worse...\" The reprimand from your hired wizard is actually correct - for once. You breathe deeply and try to calm your heartbeat.\n    \nThen you examine your loot. It is an object shaped like an oil lamp, indeed, but it doesn't appear to be an ordinary lamp. There is a big cavity where the oil should go, but you feel it is not oil that should be placed in there. Similarly, below the cavity, on the base of the lamp, there is a second opening. Perhaps it needs two items?": "“那太危险了！你不能就这样不管不顾地去抓财宝！你可能会受重伤，甚至……没命的！”你雇佣的巫师这回难得教训得在理。你深呼吸，努力平复心跳。\n    \n接着你检查了战利品。那确实是一个油灯形状的物品，但看起来并不像普通的灯。原本放油的地方有一个巨大的空腔，但你觉得那里不该放油。同样地，在空腔下方，油灯的底座上还有第二个开口。也许它需要两件物品？",
  "\"There are a lot of Goblins down here!\"\n    \nYou hear that from your hired wizard, who has been accompanying you through the disgusting traversal of the Sewers. You agree. You have seen - and felled - quite a few; you wonder if they might be nesting in this place.\n\nWhile you think about this, you spot a room to the side of the tunnel you are walking through. It is half open, and light is seeping out of the door. You decide to peek inside... and you end up finding something very interesting.": "“这下面有好多哥布林！”\n    \n你和你雇佣的巫师一起穿行于恶臭刺鼻的下水道。你深有同感。这些日子里你已经见过并杀掉了不少；你怀疑它们在这里安了窝。\n\n正当你思索这些时，你在穿行的隧道旁发现了一个房间。房门半掩，灯光从门缝里透了出来。你决定往里瞧瞧……结果发现了一些非常有趣的东西。",
  "\"These blade-wielders cannot stop us!\" Your hired wizard, as usual, appears to be excited from the adventure. She is right - they haven't been able to keep you from heading ever deeper. But it looks like you don't need to continue any further. You encounter a place that resembles a throne room, with torches lining up a straight line to what would be the throne. And in the throne... is...\n    \nYou hear a loud cry from a bird coming from that throne, but it's not a bird. It's a *sphinx*! You take a step back, but the sphinx does not wait. It begins to charge straight at you. And as it does so, you notice its large wings on its back - it is not just a feline! It must be the owner of this place, and they are definitely aggressive. You quickly and unexpectedly prepare for a challenging battle.\n\n**You can now fight the boss of \"The Sphinx\"!**": "“这些玩刀的可拦不住我们！”你雇佣的巫师一如既往地对冒险充满兴奋。她说得对——他们拦截不住你们深入的脚步。但看来你不需要再继续走下去了。你来到一个类似王座大厅的地方，火炬沿着直线延伸至王座。而在王座上坐着的……是……\n    \n你听到从王座上传来一声响亮的鸟鸣，但那不是鸟。那是一只*斯芬克斯*！你后退了一步，但斯芬克斯并没有等待。它径直向你冲来。就在这时，你注意到了它背上巨大的翅膀——它可不只是一只大猫！它一定是这里的主人，而且极具攻击性。你迅速且严阵以待，准备迎接一场艰难的战斗。\n\n**你现在可以挑战“斯芬克斯”的首领了！**",
  "\"They are powerful, but if you are able to walk through here... it means *YOU* are powerful too!\"\n  \nThe eloquent figure then says: \"If you are able to take care of *at least four different kinds* and obtain their *extracts*, I will be *so* happy... and I'll *make sure* there is something in it for you too!\"": "“它们很强大，但如果你能走到这里……意味着*你*也很强大！”\n  \n那位口若悬河的人影接着说道：“如果你能解决*至少四种不同类型*的目标并获得它们的*提取物*，我会非常开心的……而且我*保证*也会给你一些丰厚的回报！”",

  "\"Ugh... *how*...\" Satell's voice is now weaker, and you can barely make up what he is saying.\n      \nA bright flash of light appears right next to him. Instinctively, you take a step back.

  "\"Wait\", exclaims your companion. \"There is a note still in the container.\"\n      \nYou follow her finger. Below where the stone was, there is, indeed, a piece of paper.

  "\"We are *finally* here!\" You hear your travel companion exclaim from behind.\n  \nIn front of you is a large, intricately designed gate with golden-lined metal bars. Above, you see a carving of a trophy with the same shape you had seen before, and with writing inscribed right below it: *\"The School\"*. And through the closed gate you can see a majestic central building in the distance, almost like a palace; surrounded by other smaller buildings, which you guess are dorms and research buildings.": "“我们*终于*到了！”你听到旅伴在身后欢呼。\n  \n在你面前是一座巨大且设计精巧的大门，带有金边的金属格栅。在大门上方，你看到一个奖杯形状的雕塑，和你之前见过的一模一样，下方刻写着：*“学院”*。透过紧闭的大门，你可以看到远方一座宏伟的中心建筑，宛如宫殿；周围环绕着其他较小的建筑，你猜想那些是宿舍和研究楼。",
  "\"We should take a look!\" Your hired wizard sprints forward, and leans over to read the scroll. You follow her, and skim the top.

I-I cannot... *will not*... let you touch that power!\"\n\nHe waves his weapon at you, and a powerful fireball appears out of nowhere and is thrown at you! You manage to dodge it. It smashes against the door, which catches on fire.": "“你、你挺强的……但贤者之石……贤者之石及其蕴含的力量，可、可不是随便什么人都能染指的！”\n    \n他继续说道：“我、我是这所学院的校长……作为校长……我、我决不……*决不容许*……你碰触那股力量！”\n\n他挥舞武器指向你，一个强大的火球凭空出现并朝你飞过！你设法躲开了。火球撞在门上，火光瞬间蔓延开来。",
  "\"You appear quite exhausted, but your new gadget looks amazing!\" He points at that last Monstium Catalyst. \"And I feel like it looks *just* like this one here... hold on...\"\n      \nHe takes off his bag, and you watch him as he browses through its contents. It is actually full of various books. He pulls one from the pile. It reads: *\"How to Scam People\"*.\n\n\"Oh, wait, it's not this one,\" he exclaims, putting it back inside. He continues to look through and finally pulls another thin tome. It looks quite similar to a book you have. This one is called: *\"Outmonstiumed\"* and has a Monstium Catalyst in the cover, together with outlines of many more.": "“你看起来精疲力竭，但你的新小玩意儿看起来棒极了！”他指向那最后一个魔物质催化剂。“我觉得它看起来*简直*和这个一模一样……等等……”\n      \n他取下包，你看着他在里面翻找。里面其实装满了各种各样的书。他从书堆里抽出一本。上面写着：*《如何诈骗》*。\n\n“哦，等等，不是这一本，”他惊呼道，把它塞了回去。他继续寻找，最后抽出了另一本薄薄的册子。它看起来和你拥有的一本书非常相似。这本叫作：*《魔力极限》*，封面图是一个魔物质催化剂，旁边还有许多其他催化剂的轮廓。",
  "\"You have yet one more challenge to go through before you can complete the training, however\", she says. \"Each of those Towers tested your ability and affinity with a different Element. But, in actual combat against real adversaries, a Wizard will need to know the strengths and the weakness of each element, and combine them in order to craft the right strategy. It is a very important lesson.\"\n    \nThen she tells you more: \"Because of that reason, I will see how you do in battle by myself, in a duel. If you are able to hold your own against me, I will deem you worthy of having finished the training.\"": "“不过，在完成训练之前，你还有一个挑战要面对，”她说，“之前的每一座塔都测试了你对不同元素的掌控能力和亲和力。但在真正的实战中，巫师必须了解每种元素的优缺点，并将其结合以制定正确的策略。这是一门非常重要的课程。”\n    \n接着她又告诉你：“基于这个原因，我将在决斗中亲自观察你的表现。如果你能在我的攻击下支撑住，我就认为你已经达到了完成训练的标准。”",
  "\"You would... *really*... ignore my condition...? Just... for your *mission*...\" Her voice is filled with rage. You shiver; you feel you cannot look at her in the eye.\n    \n\"Then... You leave me no choice...\"\n\nAnd just a second after she finishes saying that, you feel a strong pull on your hands. Distracted as you were by her, you don't realize what's going on, until it's too late: *your hired wizard has taken the Philosopher's Stone from you!*": "“你……*真的*……无视我的处境吗……？仅仅……为了你的*任务*……”她的声音充满了愤怒。你打了个寒颤，感觉不敢直视她的眼睛。\n    \n“既然如此……那你逼我没得选……”\n\n就在她话音刚落的一秒钟后，你感到双手传来一阵强烈的拉力。由于你的注意力在她身上，你没意识到发生了什么，直到一切都太迟了：*你雇佣的巫师从你手中夺走了贤者之石！*",
  "\"You're meant to put *Elements* in the grid! Then, depending on what Elements and what position you put them on, you get different *bonuses*. These boards are *rare*!\" She sounds pretty upset...\n      \nIt takes you a few minutes to get over your desire to play, but once you do, you realize this could become another great tool for your journey... And maybe finding a good Element combination will scratch that same itch?\n\n...Three Fire-in-a-row?\n\n**You have completed the \"Tic-Tac-Toe\" Storyline! You have permanently unlocked the \"Synchro\" feature, where you can arrange Elements in a grid to get various bonuses. Find the best pattern and become more powerful!**": "“你是要把*元素*放在方格里！然后根据你放的元素和位置，你会得到不同的*加成*。这种棋盘可是很*稀有*的！”她听起来相当郁闷……\n      \n你花了点时间才克制住想玩的冲动。冷静下来后，你意识到这可能会成为你旅程中的另一件利器……也许寻找某种优秀的元素组合能带来同样的乐趣？\n\n……三火连珠？\n\n**你已经完成了“三连棋”剧情线！你已永久解锁了“同步”功能，你可以在网格中排列元素以获得各种加成。寻找最佳组合，变得更强吧！**",
  "\"You... can't *seriously* be thinking about that, can you?\" His expression changes, to one of jealousy and anger. You begin to feel very uncomfortable. You thank him and swiftly retreat back to your home...": "“你……该不会*真的*在考虑那件事吧？”他的神情变得既嫉妒又愤怒。你开始感到非常局促不安。你谢过了他，迅速撤回了家中……",

Perhaps this is the key...?": "*“走吧，继续你的旅程。”*那位神圣存在扇动着双翼，在半空中漂浮起来，随后迅猛地飞离了。你目送着他们离去，但仅仅几秒钟便消失在视线之外。\n  \n你花了点时间思考这种新力量，并看向那份神圣剧本。也许这就是关键……？",
  "*\"Halt there.\"* He raises his hand at you, prompting you to stop.\n  \n*\"It makes no sense for you to fight me today. Not only would you stand absolutely no chance as you are right now, but I'm not your real objective.\"*\n\nInstead, he reaches in between his armor and pulls... an *envelope*?": "*“停下。”* 他朝你举起手，示意你止步。\n  \n*“今天和我交战毫无意义。不仅是因为现在的你根本毫无胜算，更因为我并非你真正的目标。”*\n\n随后，他将手伸进铠甲缝隙，掏出了……一封*信封*？",
  "*\"NO!\"* The Divine screams. *\"How can you be protected against such a thing, if you're not a Divine...?!\" He begins to charge another beam, but you leap and strike at him before he is able to finish!\n\n*\"Ugh! I'm NOT letting you have the Philosopher's Stone!!\"* With another motion, the Divine creates a dimensional portal, and quickly steps through it... with the Philosopher's Stone.": "*“不！”*神圣者尖叫道。*“如果你不是神圣之躯，怎么可能挡得住那一击……？！”*他开始为另一道光束蓄力，但在他完成之前，你纵身一跃击中了他！\n\n*“呃！我绝不会让你得到贤者之石！！”*神圣者再次挥动手臂，开启了一道空间传送门，带着贤者之石迅速遁入其中……",
  "*\"Stop for a second. We need to talk.\"*\n  \nThe imposing voice comes from behind you. You turn around, and you see a being fully covered in plate armor with large white wings. You can tell - this has to be another *Divine*. You grab your weapon instinctively, but the entity gestures you to put it down. You reluctantly do so, even if somewhat blinded by rage.": "*“稍等片刻。我们需要谈谈。”*\n  \n一个威严的声音从你身后传来。你转过身，看到一个全身覆盖着板甲、长着巨大白色羽翼的生物。你能感觉到——这一定是另一位*神圣者*。你本能地握紧武器，但那个存在示意你放下。尽管怒火中烧，你还是不情愿地照做了。",
  "*\"Today... we will not be fighting. Didn't you know...?\"*\n  \nConfused, you listen to the Divine. He continues:\n\n*\"You are attempting the Universal Challenge! Your goal was not to recover the Philosopher's Stone. It was to transcend humanity.\"*": "*“今天……我们不会战斗。难道你不知道吗……？”*\n  \n你满怀困惑地听着神圣者继续说道：\n\n*“你正在尝试全能挑战！你的目标从来都不是回收贤者之石，而是超越人类的极限。”*",
  "*\"WELCOME!\"*\n      \nThe loud sound startles you as you place one foot on the structure. The source is... a humanoid with a pumpkin head. It looks just like a Spookist, but they seem more refined - its clothing looks clean and high-class.\n\nYou ready for combat, but the pumpkin head gestures you not to worry.": "*“欢迎光临！”*\n      \n当你踏上建筑的一瞬间，巨大的声响吓了你一跳。声音的来源是……一个长着南瓜头的类人生物。它看起来很像惊悚者，但显得更加优雅——它的衣服干净且高级。\n\n你摆出战斗姿态，但南瓜头打手势示意你不必担心。",
  "*\"Where do YOU think you're going?\"*\n\nThe message comes from another humanoid. You realize this is the source of the spell that hit you. You take a look at it. It's a being with multiple arms - and bandages fully covering their face.": "*“你觉得你能去哪儿？”*\n\n这段信息来自另一个类人生物。你意识到这就是刚才击中你的法术的来源。你打量着它——这是一个长着多条手臂、面部完全被绷带覆盖的生物。",
  "*\"YOU!\"* You hear the Divine screaming. It appears he was struck by something. Shortly after, you feel a flurry of Mind spells being flung across the room. Then you notice: *it is the Mindbender*!\n  \nBefore you have time to react, you hear a loud ripping sound. You realize the Divine has just opened a large dimensional portal! Before you can react, he crosses it, and flies away at a high speed. The portal then begins to close...": "*“是你！”*你听到神圣者在尖叫。他似乎被什么东西击中了。紧接着，你感觉到一阵精神法术在房间里横冲直撞。这时你注意到了：*是夺心者*！\n  \n还没等你反应过来，你就听到一声巨大的撕裂声。你意识到神圣者刚刚开启了一个巨大的空间传送门！在你出手干预之前，他已跨过门户，疾速飞向远方。传送门开始缓缓关闭……",
  "*\"You dare tell us... that we just HAND OVER the Stone... to a THIEF?!\"* Its voice is very deep, loud and powerful, and just hearing it fills you with unease.\n    \n*\"Do you even know WHO you are talking to, impudent spellcaster?\"*\n\nConnecting the dots, it is obvious: from how they are dressed, and where they are... are they the King of the Zeth? The ruler of the lost Kingdom...? You shudder, as you realize this.": "*“你竟敢让我们……把贤者之石……亲手交给一个窃贼？！”*那声音深沉、宏亮且充满威严，仅仅听着就让你感到强烈的不安。\n    \n*“鲁莽的施法者，你可知道自己在跟谁说话？”*\n\n串联起所有的线索，真相呼之欲出：从他们的打扮以及身处的位置来看……难道他们是泽斯的国王？那个失落国度的统治者……？想到这里，你不寒而栗。",
  "*\"You did it; out of your own strength. We have been watching\"*, they say with a strong voice. \"You have proven that you are strong enough to handle what you call the Philosopher's Stone.\"\n\nYou are a little dizzy, still in disbelief. You actually *bested a Divine in battle*...": "*“你做到了；全凭你自己的力量。我们一直在注视着你，”*他们以有力的声音说道，“你已经证明了自己拥有足够的实力，去驾驭这颗被你们称为贤者之石的东西。”\n\n你感到有些眩晕，仍不敢置信。你竟然真的在战斗中*击败了一位神圣者*……",
  "*\"You m-must not use it!\"* The Headmaster, with a stuttery voice, interjects in the conversation. \"I-It holds a terrible power...! Y-Your kingdom was *ruined* by this Stone!\"\n\nThe humanoid, however, just laughs again. \"And what would YOU know about *our history*? *No*! It was not the Stone that ruined our kingdom. It was *its absence* that did! If it wasn't for that... *rogue*... your world would still be *ours*!\"": "*“不……你绝对不能用它！”*校长的声音颤抖着，插话道，“它……它蕴含着恐怖的力量……！你们的王国就是被这块圣石*摧毁*的！”\n\n然而，那个类人生物只是再次大笑起来。“你对*我们的历史*又了解多少？*不*！摧毁我们王国的不是圣石。恰恰是因为*失去了它*！如果不是因为那个……*叛徒*……你们的世界现在依然*属于我们*！”",

For example, you can combine three Longsword +1 to obtain a Longsword +2.\n\nYou have options to automate combination. You can enable auto-combination for specific items in their item details in the Inventory screen, or you can enable it for all equipment (except Pouch items) from the \"More actions...\" menu in the same screen.\n\nWhile higher level items are usually stronger than lower level items, item quality can drastically change this. *Do not underestimate low-level items* - if you can Transmute them easily, you will be able to obtain a piece with much higher item quality, and in some cases it will be worth it!": "**物品品质**是应用于某些装备的修正值。它通过物品名称的后缀来表示，例如 *+1*、*+2* 等。\n\n物品品质每提升一级，其大部分效果将获得 10% 的乘法加成。例如，普通长剑提供 +30:attack:，那么长剑 +1 将提供 +33:attack:，而长剑 +10 将提供 +78:attack:。此外，其售价也会获得 50% 的乘法加成。\n      \n你可以将三件相同的装备（包括收纳袋物品）合成，以获得一件高一级品质的装备。例如，你可以将三把长剑 +1 合成为一把长剑 +2。\n\n你可以选择自动合成。在库存界面的物品详情中，你可以为特定物品开启自动合成；或者在同一界面的“更多操作...”菜单中为所有装备（收纳袋物品除外）开启此功能。\n\n虽然高级别物品通常比低级别物品更强，但物品品质可以彻底改变这一点。*不要低估低级别物品*——如果你能通过“转化”轻松大量获得它们，你就能合成出物品品质极高的装备，在某些情况下这非常值得！",

  ":retirement:**Retirement** is one of the most powerful features in the game. In essence, retiring allows you to restart the game from the beginning, including choosing a new primary Element. However, there are strong benefits to retirement which are detailed below.\n    \nWhen you retire, the level your primary Element is currently at is permanently recorded. This level is called the **Maximum Primary Level**, or **MPL**. The MPL for an Element can never go down - if you re-select an Element as your primary and then retire again without reaching your previous MPL, you will keep the previous value.\n\nAfter you retire, you will get a **Global Study Exp Multiplier**. This multiplier is very important, as it can vastly improve the effectiveness of studying, letting you unlock stronger spells much, much quicker.\n\nIn addition, there is a similar **Global Production Multiplier** which will affect all resource production you have from Channeling, furniture and other features in the game. This includes Mana, which means after retirement it should be much easier to cast stronger spells or cast spells more often. This also affects :coins: and :monstium: dropped in Exploration.\n\nBoth of the multipliers above are determined based on two factors. The first is the maximum MPL you have ever achieved, regardless of Element. This is the main factor impacting the two multipliers. The second is the sum of all the MPLs you have across all the Elements. This is a secondary factor and it will impact the multipliers, but not as much. Because of this, it's recommended to **pick a new Primary Element when retiring** if possible, to maximize the bonuses.\n\nOne last benefit from retirement is related to Storylines. Any **benefits acquired from Storylines will persist through retirements**, meaning progress will become faster. In addition, some Storylines only provide their benefit after you retire once - retiring is encouraged in order to get the full benefit in those cases.\n\nDeciding when to retire is very important. One suggestion is to retire if progress has gotten slower or achieving the next Goal (see: **Home** help section) appears impossible. Another is to retire if the Study exp and production multipliers will substantially increase, or if you complete a Storyline with powerful effects that only appear after retirement. For the first retirement *only*, it is usually a good idea to retire if your new Global Study Exp Multiplier will be above 2.5x (i.e. do not retire right away after unlocking Retirement).": ":retirement:**归隐**是游戏中最强大的功能之一。本质上，归隐允许你从头开始游戏，包括选择一个新的主修元素。然而，归隐带来的强大收益在下文中详细列出。\n    \n当你归隐时，你当前主修元素的等级会被永久记录下来。这个等级被称为**最高主修等级**，简称 **MPL**。某个元素的 MPL 永远不会下降——如果你再次选择该元素作为主修并重新归隐，即使未达到之前的 MPL，你仍将保留之前的高值。\n\n归隐后，你将获得一个**全局学习经验加成**。这个倍率非常重要，因为它能极大地提高学习效率，让你更快地解锁更强大的法术。\n\n此外，还有一个类似的**全局产量加成**，它会影响你从引导、家具和游戏中其他功能获得的所有资源产量。这包括魔力，意味着归隐后应该更容易施放更强的法术或提高施法频率。这也会影响在探索中掉落的:coins:和:monstium:。\n\n上述两个倍率均由两个因素决定。第一个因素是你曾达到的所有元素中最高的 MPL，这是影响两个倍率的主要因素。第二个因素是你所有元素的 MPL 之和。这是一个次要因素，虽然也会影响加成，但程度较小。因此，建议在归隐时尽可能**选择一个新的主修元素**，以最大化加成收益。\n\n归隐的最后一个好处与剧情线有关。任何**从剧情线中获得的收益都将在归隐后保留**，这意味着进度会变快。此外，某些剧情线仅在你至少归隐一次后才会提供收益——在这些情况下，鼓励通过归隐来获得全部收益。\n\n决定何时归隐至关重要。一个建议是，如果进度变慢或下一个目标（见“**主页**”帮助部分）似乎无法完成时，就选择归隐。另一个建议是，如果学习经验和产量加成将大幅增加，或者你完成了在归隐后才生效的强力剧情线，也可以选择归隐。*仅针对第一次归隐*，通常建议当你的新全局学习经验倍率高于 2.5 倍时再归隐（即：不要在刚解锁归隐功能时立即归隐）。",

  "After the Sewer Entrance, you may start finding various ways to inflict a status effect called Poison.\n      \nIn a nutshell, Poison reduces :hp: over time while active.

The exception to this rule are Poison effects caused by pouch items.\n* **If you apply *a different* Poison effect, it will not stack.** Instead, the effect with the highest \"potential damage\" will stay. Potential damage is calculated by multiplying the remaining duration by the magnitude of the effect. For example, if an enemy has a -10:hp:/sec effect that lasts for 10 more seconds and you apply a new -30:hp:/sec effect that lasts for 2 seconds, the enemy will keep the former since 100 (10:hp: times 10 seconds) is greater than 60 (30:hp: times 2 seconds).": "通过下水道入口后，你可能会开始发现各种可以施加“中毒”状态效果的方法。\n\n简而言之，中毒会在生效期间随时间降低:hp:。这种伤害会忽略:defense:和:dodge:。\n\n一个目标在任何给定时间内只能激活一种中毒效果：\n\n* 如果你多次施加*同一种*中毒效果（即来源相同且造成的:hp:伤害相同），该效果的*持续时间*将会叠层。腰包道具造成的中毒效果除外。\n* **如果你施加了*不同的*中毒效果，它们不会叠层。** 相反，具有最高“潜在伤害”的效果将保留。潜在伤害是通过剩余持续时间乘以效果强度来计算的。例如，如果敌人有一个持续 10 秒且每秒 -10:hp:的效果，而你施加了一个持续 2 秒且每秒 -30:hp:的新效果，敌人将保留前者，因为 100（10:hp:乘以 10 秒）大于 60（30:hp:乘以 2 秒）。",

If you run out of :land: and cannot afford to expand, you can always dispose of some of your Furniture to make room; you can do so by expanding the Furniture on the Home screen.\n\nIn this game mode, the costs of Furniture will increase more slowly than in the Classic game mode, allowing you to build more of them with the same amount of resources. For example, if you have 4K Max:wateressence:, in \"Modern\" you will be able to build 27 Mana Spouts, but in \"Classic\" that will only be 25 - even if their cost is not increased due to lack of :land:.\n\nAs a reminder, you can switch between game modes in the Options menu.": "在“现代”游戏模式中，你需要谨慎决定建造哪些家具。在这种模式下，家园中家具的种类和数量选择是游戏最大的挑战之一。\n\n你的家园可用于家具的:land:土地非常有限。你可以通过在家园界面购买更多:land:来扩展空间，但这很昂贵且需要消耗:coins:金币。如果土地耗尽且买不起更多，你可以随时拆除部分家具以腾出空间；只需在家园界面展开家具项即可操作。\n\n在此模式下，家具成本的增速比经典模式慢，允许你在相同资源下建造更多家具。例如，如果你有 4K 最大:wateressence:，在“现代”模式你可以建造 27 个魔力喷泉，而在“经典”模式只能建造 25 个——即使成本没有因为缺乏:land:而增加也是如此。\n\n提示：你可以在选项菜单中切换游戏模式。 :land:",

Typically, what this means is that you'll want to focus on two types of Boost to maximize your gain.\n\nYou can reset your Boosts at no cost. This will remove all your Boosts, bringing them all back to 0. However, it'll also reset their cost, meaning you're free to distribute them to other stats.\n\nSome build ideas:\n\n* You can Boost :attack: and :attackDelay: together to greatly increase your damage per second from your weapon!\n* You can Boost :defense: and :mana: regeneration together to be able to cast many spells - while receiving less damage! (Best if paired with an armor with high :defense:)\n\nOverall, Enhancements are usually a better way to spend :monstium: as the bonuses tend to be larger, but don't overlook Boosts - especially if you're stuck in a boss and you could use the extra strength!\n\nUnlocking new Elements will let you Boost different attributes - keep an eye on this screen every now and then!": "在:boosts:**增幅**界面，你可以获得许多属性的半永久加成，从而自定义你的流派并专精于特定属性！\n      \n属性增幅需要消耗:monstium:魔物质和元素精华。购买一项增幅会增加该项增幅所需的:monstium:和精华成本，同时也会增加所有其他类型增幅的:monstium:成本。通常这意味着你应该专注于一到两种增幅以实现收益最大化。\n\n你可以免费重置属性增幅。这将移除所有增幅并将其归零。同时成本也会重置，意味着你可以自由地将它们重新分配到其他属性上。\n\n一些流派思路：\n\n* 同时增幅:attack:攻击力和:attackDelay:攻击延迟，以大幅提高武器的每秒伤害！\n* 同时增幅:defense:防御和:mana:魔力再生，以便能施放更多法术，同时受到的伤害更少！（最好搭配高:defense:防御的盔甲）\n\n总的来说，强化通常是消耗:monstium:魔物质更好的方式，因为加成往往更显著，但也不要忽视属性增幅——尤其是当你卡在某个 Boss 关卡需要额外战力时！\n\n解锁新元素后将允许你增幅不同的属性——记得经常查看这个界面！",

  "In the :familiars:**Familiars** screen, you can view and command your best friends, creatures that can fight at your side or even explore for you - Familiars!\n      \nTo obtain a Familiar, you will need to build a furniture called *Familiar Crate*. This furniture requires :lifeessence:Life essence. After you do so, you will immediately obtain a new Slime Familiar.\n\nBy expanding a Familiar in the Familiars screen, you can see a breakdown of their stats, as well as their recent activity. You can also Summon the Familiar so that it fights at your side while you Explore, or you can send the Familiar to any area you have unlocked the boss of and have them Explore it by themselves.\n\nIf you Summon the Familiar, they will fight at your side. They will attack the enemy during Exploration, and they are able to take their hits for you. There are more details in the Help item *\"Combat with Familiars\"* under the Exploration category.\n\nIf you tell the Familiar to Explore by themselves, they will do so automatically - and when they encounter an enemy, they will either immediately defeat it, netting you their loot; or they will fail, in which case they will just Explore the same area again. The higher your Familiar's level is, the higher the chance of success will become. Having a higher level Familiar explore a lower level area also reduces the amount of time they spend Exploring.\n\nYou can also tell the familiar to \"Auto-Explore\". They will essentially Explore by themselves, but they will constantly move to the highest-level unlocked area that they can safely Explore without you having to reassign them. This is usually the best choice if you are trying to obtain :monstium:, :coins: or levels.\n\nFamiliars gain Exp by either being active in combat and next to you when you defeat an enemy in Exploration, or by simply succeeding when they Explore by themselves. Typically, Exp gained while they are fighting with you is higher. In addition, when a Familiar successfully fights an enemy that is consider stronger than themselves, they will gain even more Exp. Letting Familiars fight at your side against challenging enemies is one of the best ways to increase their level.\n\nThere are also rumors of specific items that can be Transmuted, that can drastically change the appearance of a Familiar, making them stronger and shifting their combat moves...": "在:familiars:**使魔**界面，你可以查看并指挥你最忠实的朋友，这些生物可以与你并肩作战，甚至替你探索——它们就是使魔！\n      \n要获得使魔，你需要建造名为“使魔箱”的家具。建造该家具需要:lifeessence:生命精华。完成后，你将立即获得一只新的史莱姆使魔。\n\n在使魔界面展开使魔，你可以查看它们的属性详情及近期动态。你可以召唤使魔在探索时与你并肩作战，也可以派使魔前往任何已解锁首领的区域进行独立探索。\n\n如果你召唤使魔，它们会随你出战。在探索中它们会攻击敌人，并能为你抵挡伤害。更多细节请参见探索分类下的帮助项“与使魔战斗”。\n\n如果你让使魔独立探索，它们会自动进行——遇到敌人时，它们若成功击败敌人则会为你带来战利品；若失败，则会再次探索同一区域。使魔等级越高，成功率越大。让高等级使魔探索低级区域还能缩短探索时间。\n\n你还可以让使魔“自动探索”。它们会自动往复，并不断转移到它们能安全探索的最高级解锁区域，无需你手动重新分配。这通常是获取:monstium:魔物质、:coins:金币或等级的最佳选择。\n\n使魔通过两种方式获得经验：一是在探索中随你出战并击败敌人，二是独立探索成功。通常随你战斗获得的经验更高。此外，当使魔成功击败比自己更强的敌人时，会获得更多经验。让使魔与你一起挑战强敌是提升等级的最佳途径之一。\n\n此外还有传闻称，通过转化某些特定物品可以彻底改变使魔的外观，使其变得更强并改变战斗招式……",

That means Death needs to be unlocked to use them. The higher your Death level is, the more Rituals you will have access to.\n\nEach active Ritual gives you a fixed amount of :corruption:Corruption.

This severely cripples your combat abilities for a minute. Because of this, activating rituals during combat is unwise.": "在 :rituals:**仪式**界面中，你可以开启或停止仪式。仪式是强大的半永久性加成，能够影响游戏的许多方面！但作为代价，它们会使你受到腐蚀。为了进一步提升力量，你愿意承担多少 :corruption:腐蚀……？\n      \n仪式的解锁取决于你的死亡元素等级。这意味着必须解锁死亡元素才能使用仪式。你的死亡等级越高，能使用的仪式就越多。\n\n每项激活的仪式都会给你提供固定数量的 :corruption:腐蚀。你的身体能承受的腐蚀程度有一定的限制：基础上限仅为 1:corruption:。如果你的 :corruption: 超过了上限，你的能力将根据超出程度而受损：\n\n* 略微超过上限，你的最大:hp:将受到惩罚。\n* 如果超出上限 3:corruption: 或更多，你获得的元素经验也将受到大幅削减。\n* 最后，如果超出上限达 5:corruption: 或更多，转化法术所需的物品和资源数量将受到极其严厉的惩罚。\n\n激活仪式还会使你获得一个名为*“仪式虚弱”*的临时减益效果。这会在一分钟内严重削弱你的战斗能力。因此，在战斗期间激活仪式并非明智之举。",

You can reassign Elements to the grid anytime.\n      \nYou can place each Element up to 2 times in the grid, and because of the size and shape of the grid, the maximum amount of bonuses you can have is 12. Bonuses are multiplicative with each other.\n\nSome bonus effects may show up as \"???\". If that is the case, it's because you haven't yet unlocked what the effect does. For example, if an effect would give +10% Droplet of Healing spell power, but you hadn't unlocked the spell Droplet of Healing, it would appear as \"???\". In addition, sometimes, a pair of Elements may not provide a bonus, or it might give a bonus with negative effects. Optimize your grid so that you avoid these negative effects!\n\nYou have the ability to set up 8 grids in total. However, only the active grid will provide its bonuses at any time. You can swap between grids quickly either from the Synchro screen, or from the Exploration screen, under the Strategy tab.\n\nSome grid ideas:\n\n* You can easily obtain 4 times of a single boost by creating a 2x2 square within the grid where the top-left and bottom-right are the same Element, and the top-right and bottom-left are another Element.\n* Fire+Earth is a good combination for melee builds.

For example, you can fill your pouch with four :cherry:Cherry.\n      \nPouch items can be used only during combat, and each one will have a certain amount of uses. Entering a new combat will refresh the pouch items and restore their uses.\n\nMost pouch items will be used automatically during combat unless you disable this behavior in the \"Items\" tab in Exploration. Healing items will typically be used if your :hp: is dangerously low, or if you would obtain their full effect. Buffing items will typically be used whenever the buff is not present, which is usually at the beginning of a battle.\n\nPouch items are key to succeeding in Exploration, and may be your main source of healing during combat for a good portion of the game. Think very carefully about what pouch items to equip before entering combat: you will need to wait until the next combat to use it if you equip a new pouch item while you are already fighting.": "腰包道具是一类重要的*装备*。它们通常是能够恢复:hp:或提供限时增益效果的药水或水果。你可以通过库存界面装备腰包道具。\n\n**腰包道具不是消耗品，使用后不会消失。** 它们被视为装备的一种。游戏开始时你拥有四个腰包道具栏位，并且可以在这些栏位中装备多个相同的道具。例如，你可以用四个:cherry:樱桃 填满你的腰包。\n      \n腰包道具只能在战斗中使用，且每件道具都有一定的次数限制。进入新的战斗会刷新腰包道具并恢复使用次数。\n\n除非你在“探索”界面的“道具”标签页中禁用此行为，否则大多数腰包道具会在战斗中自动使用。通常，当你的:hp:处于危险状态或可以获得完整治疗效果时，会使用治疗道具。而增益类道具通常会在增益效果消失时使用，这通常发生在战斗开始时。\n\n腰包道具是成功进行“探索”的关键，并且在游戏的大部分时间里可能是你战斗中主要的治疗来源。在进入战斗前请仔细考虑要装备哪些腰包道具：如果你在战斗中更换了腰包道具，则必须等到下一场战斗才能开始使用它。",

  "The Perma-Cast Storyline reward allows your wizards to *Perma-Cast* a spell. Perma-Casting a spell essentially makes your Wizards cast the spell again, indefinitely, as fast as possible or as soon as it's estimated to be needed again. Instead of draining your :mana: all at once at the time the spell is cast, your :mana: will instead be drained over time.\n      \nYou can set a spell to Perma-Cast from each individual spell's details. Not every spell is available for Perma-Cast: usually, they need to either have a cooldown or grant a buff or a debuff to be Perma-Cast eligible.\n\nPerma-Cast's ease of setup is one of its biggest advantages, and is especially good for buffs that you always want to have on, such as Enchant Mana Spouts. When a buff or debuff is caused by a spell you have on Perma-Cast, it will be displayed with a (P) on any lists of buffs or debuffs, and it will show towards the bottom of the list so that you don't need to worry about its presence.\n\nAnother, more subtle advantage of Perma-Cast is that Wizards assigned to Perma-Cast spells will pool together their :wizardpower:, so you will likely need less Wizards than if you had individual rules for all of them. Any Wizards not assigned to any other rule will be considered for Perma-Cast.\n\nIf your :mana: or :wizardpower: generation is not large enough to sustain all your Perma-Cast spells, your Wizards will first prioritize spells that could help with the problem, such as Enchant Mana Spouts. Afterwards, they will prioritize those that are \"cheaper\", so that most of the effects stay valid. However, despite this, it can still cause problems if it isn't resolved. If this is happening, your Wizards menu icon will change, letting you know that there is an unsolved issue.\n\nWhen you save or load Wizard Strategies, the Perma-Cast spell configuration is also saved. When you load a Wizard Strategy, if your :mana: or :wizardpower: is not enough to sustain all the spells, Perma-Cast spells will be disabled starting from the most expensive. You can utilize this feature to, for example, load a Strategy early in the game, get more Wizards and :mana: generation, then load the same Strategy again to cover more of its spells.\n\nThe list of Perma-Cast spells in the Wizards menu is sorted by inverse priority order. Your Wizards will prioritize the spells at the bottom of this list. The spells at the top are often the most expensive, so if you don't have enough resources to keep up Perma-Cast, turning off these spells will have the biggest impact.": "“恒定施法”剧情线奖励允许你的巫师*恒定施法*。恒定施法本质上是让你的巫师无限期地、尽可能快地或者在预计需要时立即再次施放该法术。与其在施法那一刻一次性消耗全部:mana:，你的:mana:将随着时间推移持续消耗。\n      \n你可以在每个法术的详情中设置恒定施法。并非所有法术都可以恒定施法：通常法术需要有冷却时间，或者是提供增益/减益效果才有资格被设为恒定施法。\n\n恒定施法设置简便，这是它最大的优点之一，特别适合那些你希望一直保持的增益效果，比如“附魔魔力喷泉”。当一个增益或减益效果是由恒定施法产生时，在列表里会带有一个 (P) 标记，并且会显示在列表底部，这样你就不用担心其存在感太强。\n\n恒定施法的另一个微妙优势是，分配给恒定施法法术的巫师会共享他们的:wizardpower:，因此比起为每个人单独设置规则，你可能只需要更少的巫师。任何没有分配到其他规则的巫师都会被自动考虑用于恒定施法。\n\n如果你的:mana:或:wizardpower:生成速度不足以维持所有恒定施法法术，巫师会首先优先施放能解决问题的法术，例如“附魔魔力喷泉”。之后，他们会优先保留消耗“较低”的法术，以确保大部分效果依然有效。尽管如此，如果问题仍未解决，还是会导致问题。发生这种情况时，巫师菜单图标会发生变化，告知你存在未解决的问题。\n\n当你保存或加载巫师策略时，恒定施法配置也会随之保存。加载策略时，如果你的:mana:或:wizardpower:不足以维持所有法术，恒定施法将从最昂贵的法术开始逐个禁用。你可以利用此功能，例如在游戏早期加载策略，然后在获得更多巫师和魔力生成后，再次加载相同的策略以启用更多法术。\n\n巫师菜单中的恒定施法列表是按逆优先级排序的。巫师会优先维持列表底部的法术。顶部的法术通常最昂贵，因此如果你发现资源跟不上，关掉这些法术效果最明显。 :mana:",

To your surprise, it appears to be stunned! You get ready to strike again, but you notice your hired wizard's body - and the skeleton - shaking, as if out of control. A short while after, the skeleton begins to fade into nothingness, and your wizard companion falls limply on the ground. Did you win...?\n      \nWhat was all that about? She stole the Philosopher's Stone from you, and then... she got possessed by it.

You search around your deceased companion. It seemed like it was nowhere to be found, but then... you notice a cracked rock, close to her body. It appears to be out of place.

  "Whew - not only did you manage to find me, but also, you were able to defeat all my *overpowered* tricks! Congratulations!\n    \nThis ending is not part of the story of the game. Instead, it is a special, hidden ending meant only for those who have gone above and beyond in their playthrough of Magic Research 2.\n\nA few months after I finished the development of Magic Research - the \"prequel\" to Magic Research 2, and the first commercial game I released - I realized it was much more successful than I originally thought it would be. It was strongly inspirational, and pushed me to spend even more of my time in the game, slowly improving it more and more. But one thing was difficult: adding *more content* to the game. It was mainly difficult because the game felt *complete*, and by the time you finished it, you were so powerful and able to break almost every mechanic that it was hard to add on any new content.\n\nInstead, I decided to focus many of the new ideas into a small prototype, of a similar game. A better way to automatically cast spells. More significance and variety to Element choice. The ability to get more powerful simply by \"leveling up\". The removal of the tedium of crafting consumable items. More clarity on Storyline unlock conditions, and less dependence on randomness. More variety in items and spells, with large amounts of synergies. And, of course - wrapping all of that with a new story.\n\nOf course, the prototype grew and grew. Soon enough, I found it was fun - just as fun as Magic Research. That meant one thing: this prototype stood a chance at being another good game!\n\nFrom that point onwards, I kept improving it. I went through the game three times (or more!) as I balanced it, over and over, removing as many annoyances as I could. I caught myself hooked into the challenges of my own ideation, trying to figure out what was the best way to solve them. And eventually... it became Magic Research 2. What you see now, and what you have just played through.\n\nBuilding Magic Research 2 was fun, without a doubt. But it would be a lie if I said it was the same as making my first game, Magic Research. This time, it was much more difficult - there was a very high bar to meet, set by the previous release. The pressure of making an entirely new game that is just as good - or better - loomed over me as I developed it. In the end... I found myself playing this game countless hours out of pleasure, so I feel I might have succeeded.\n\nYou have made it all the way here. I'm hoping your journey through the game was just as enjoyable as mine was.\n\nOnce more - congratulations, and enjoy your secret Storyline!\n\n-@Maticolotto": "呼——你不仅设法找到了我，还打败了我所有*超纲*的把戏！恭喜你！\n    \n这个结局并不是游戏剧情的一部分。相反，它是一个特殊的、隐藏的结局，仅献给那些在《Magic Research 2》中超越自我、完成伟业的玩家。\n\n在我完成《Magic Research》（《Magic Research 2》的前作，也是我发布的第一款商业游戏）开发的几个月后，我才意识到它比我最初预想的要成功得多。这给了我很大的鼓舞，促使我投入更多的时间在这个游戏上，慢慢地改进它。但有一件事很困难：为游戏增加*更多内容*。这主要是因为那个游戏当时给人的感觉已经很*完整*了，而且当你通关时，你已经变得极其强大，强大到能破坏几乎所有的机制，以至于很难再增加任何新的内容。\n\n于是，我决定将许多新想法集中到一个同类型游戏的小原型中。更先进的自动法术施放方式。更有存在感和多样性的元素选择。仅通过“升级”就能变强的能力。取消了制作消耗性物品时的繁琐过程。剧情线解锁条件更加清晰，减少了对随机性的依赖。更多种类的物品和法术，以及大量的协同作用。当然——还要用一个全新的故事来包装这一切。\n\n当然，这个原型不断发展。很快，我发现它很有趣——和《Magic Research》一样有趣。这意味着一件事：这个原型有机会成为另一款优秀的游戏！\n\n从那时起，我不断完善它。为了平衡性，我通关了三次（甚至更多！），反复打磨，尽可能消除一切令人不快的地方。我发现自己沉迷于自我构思出的各种挑战中，试图寻找解决它们的最佳方案。最终……它变成了《Magic Research 2》。也就是你现在所看到、且刚刚通关的作品。\n\n开发《Magic Research 2》的过程无疑充满乐趣。但如果我说这和开发第一作《Magic Research》时一样，那是在撒谎。这一次难度大得多——前作的成功设立了一个极高的门槛。开发过程中，要把这款新作做得同样出色——甚至更好——的压力始终笼罩着我。但最终……我发现自己出于纯粹的喜悦在游戏中玩了无数个小时，所以我觉得自己可能成功了。\n\n你一路披荆斩棘来到了这里。我希望你在游戏中的旅程能和我当时一样愉快。\n\n再次表示祝贺，请享受你的秘密剧情线！\n\n-@Maticolotto",

  "Your decision made, you spare no time and get to work right away. You close your eyes.

Attuned to its power, you feel the stream of Mana coursing through her body, reaching as deep as each of her fingertips.\n    \nEven with all that power, it almost feels like it's not enough. You continue directing the Mana towards her, draining even more power from the Stone. You feel the Philosopher's Stone beginning to crack under the intense exertion you are applying to it, but you don't stop. You *can't* stop: she doesn't deserve to die here.\n\nWith a last burst, you fetch the last bits of power from the Philosopher's Stone. The burst of energy is even stronger than before. Your body shakes and trembles from its power, but you stay calm, and channel it straight into her body. Exhausted of energy, the torrent from the Philosopher's Stone finally slows down. Did it work...? You are filled with anxiety, unsure of the results...\n\nYou open your eyes. In front of you, you see the Headmaster, with a frown on his face; leaning in front of your wizard companion. The hired wizard's laying down on the ground. You look down and see her, and...\n\nImmediately, you feel a *sense of relief*. Her skin color is back to normal, and she is no longer shaking. She appears to be resting peacefully, her breaths calm and controlled. You let yourself take a deep breath and relax. *It appears to have worked!*\n\nThe Headmaster speaks to you, in a serious tone. \"Thank you... thank you for *making the correct decision.*\" This time, you notice no stutter in his words. \"She appears to be fine now... she only needs a little rest. This... was definitely the best outcome.\"\n\nYou hear a soft cracking sound. You look down at your hands, at its source. You are still holding the Philosopher's Stone, but it looks quite different now. Its glow is gone, and you notice it has split into two separate pieces. It is now *just a normal rock*. With some sadness, you put the pieces down on the ground.\n\n\"I know your motivation, and I am aware just how difficult it was to decide... to decide to abandon your mission when you were so close\", says the Headmaster. \"The Philosopher's Stone is no more... but I truly believe that is for the best. After seeing what happened at the School... after seeing how deeply the Zeth were corrupted by this object... I don't think Satell's words were entirely unreasonable.\"\n\nYou look down once more at your wizard companion. Crouching next to her, you think about your original motivation. To save the entire World from that deadly disease... the same that took your dear relative. You crossed deserts, caverns, and a forest; you climbed a mountain, and even ventured into entirely foreign realms *twice*. You became a lot stronger through your journey, defeated otherworldly beings you never knew existed, and you ultimately succeeded at finding what you were looking for: the Philosopher's Stone. But in the end... all you managed to do with it was to *save a single life*. The life of your hired wizard.\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted by a weak moan. *Your wizard companion is waking up!*\n\nWith a slow, careful movement, she looks around. She first sees the Headmaster. His frown turns into a soft smile; you have never seen him express this emotion before. And then, she looks at you. And she speaks.\n\n\"You... saved me, didn't you...? ...Even if... even if it meant everyone else would not be...\" Then she closes her eyes, pauses for a while, and continues: \"I am so grateful... and relieved... words cannot express my gratitude. *Thank you.*\"\n\n**Your journey has finally come to an end.** In this distant realm, on those moonlit plains, you retrieved the Philosopher's Stone, and you used it to save a life. Your mission was a *failure*: the Philosopher's Stone is gone now, and you couldn't achieve your goal of eliminating the deadly disease that took your close relative from the World. But, despite this failure, you obtained something else, something you had never even thought of before: the unbreakable bonds you forged with your adventuring partners.\n\nAnd together, you begin the trip back... and a new journey, to face whatever the future might hold.": "下定决心后，你不再犹豫，立即开始工作。你闭上眼睛，屏息凝神，将来自贤者之石那令人难以置信的强大治愈能量注入你受雇巫师同伴病弱的身体。当你与这股力量产生共鸣时，你感觉到魔力流经她的身体，深入到她的每一处指尖。\n    \n即便拥有如此庞大的能量，似乎仍然不够。你继续将魔力引向她，从贤者之石中抽取更多的力量。你感觉到在你的剧烈透支下，贤者之石开始出现裂痕，但你没有停下。你*不能*停下：她不该死在这里。\n\n随着最后一次爆发，你榨取了贤者之石中最后的残余力量。这股能量爆发比之前还要强烈。你的身体因其威力而颤抖，但你保持冷静，将其直接引导进她的体内。能量耗尽后，来自贤者之石的洪流终于慢了下来。成功了吗……？你内心焦虑不安，对结果感到茫然……\n\n你睁开眼睛。在你面前，你看到皱着眉头的校长俯身在你的巫师同伴身边。那名受雇的巫师正躺在地上。你低下头看着她，然后……\n\n很快，你感到*如释重负*. 她的肤色恢复了正常，也不再颤抖了。她看起来正平静地休息着，呼吸平稳。你深吸一口气，放松了下来。*看来成功了！*\n\n校长用严肃的口吻对你说道：“谢谢你……谢谢你*做出了正确的决定*。”这一次，你发现他的话语不再结巴。“她现在看起来没事了……只需要稍作休息。这……绝对是最好的结果。”\n\n你听到一声轻微的碎裂声。你低下头看向手心，寻找声音的来源。你手里仍握着贤者之石，但它现在看起来完全不同了。它的光芒消失了，你注意到它裂成了两块。现在它*只是一块普通的石头*。你带着些许哀伤，将碎片放在了地上。\n\n“我明白你的动机，也清楚做出这个决定是多么困难……在如此接近目标时选择放弃你的使命，”校长说道。“贤者之石已经不复存在了……但我真心相信这是最好的安排。在目睹了学院发生的变故……目睹了泽斯人如何被这件物品深度腐蚀之后……我觉得萨特尔的话并非全无道理。”\n\n你再次低头看向你的巫师同伴。蹲在她身边，你回想起了最初的动机。为了从那种夺走你亲人的致命疫病中拯救整个世界……你穿越了沙漠、洞穴和森林；你攀登了高峰，甚至两度踏入完全异国的领域。在旅途中你变得强大了许多，击败了从未想象过的异界生物，并最终成功找到了你一直在寻找的东西：贤者之石。但到头来……你用它所做的一切，仅仅是*拯救了一个人的生命*。那就是你受雇的巫师。\n\n一声微弱的呻吟打断了你的思绪。*你的巫师同伴醒了！*\n\n她缓慢而小心地环顾四周。她先看到了校长。校长的愁容化作了一抹轻柔的微笑；你从未见过他露出这样的表情。接着，她看向了你。她开口了。\n\n“是你……救了我，对吗……？……即便……即便这意味着其他人无法得到……”然后她闭上眼睛，沉默了一会儿，继续说道：“我万分感激……也感到很庆幸……言语无法表达我的谢意。*谢谢你*。”\n\n**你的旅程终于走到了终点。** 在这遥远的领域，在洒满月光的平原上，你带回了贤者之石，并用它挽救了一个生命。你的使命*失败了*：贤者之石现在已经毁坏，你没能实现消除夺走亲人生命的疫病的初衷。但是，抛开这次失败，你获得了别的东西，那是你从未想过的：你与冒险伙伴建立的牢不可破的羁绊。\n\n于是，你们一起踏上了归途……开启了一段新的旅程，去面对未来可能发生的一切。",

You were thinking of a few options: maybe Transmuting them into something else, like a good piece of equipment. But the most likely answer is that... you're just going to *sell* them. You can never have enough :coins:!": "你的巫师同伴注意到了它们，并仔细观察。“它……非常漂亮，”她惊叹道，随后拿起一枚 /element/ 棱镜仔细端详。她问你：“你对它们有什么打算吗？”\n    \n你停顿了一会儿才回答。这确实有很多棱镜。你考虑过几个选择：或许可以把它们转化成其他东西，比如一件好装备。但最有可能的答案是……你会直接把它们*卖掉*。毕竟:coins:永远不嫌多！",
